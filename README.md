WHY THIS REPO?
==============

As "Linus Torvalds" once said (Source on WikiQuote : http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) :

		Only wimps use tape backup: 
		real men just upload their important stuff on ftp, and let the rest of the world mirror it ;)

I personally hold no bad feelings for people who use tape backups, and I even do it occassionally when I am working on a project for someone else! The point is I decided to upload my site to Github and let the rest of the world mirror it!!

I also want to monitor the progress of moving it into the great PHP framework"Symfony 2".
