Hello, world! I am Mosab Ahmad. A passionate software engineer, supposedly a

I have decided to coin my own law : Mosabâ€™s Law Of Conservation of Software Bugs

```Software Bugs may be created but can not be fully destroyed.```

This law is inspired by the law of conservation of energy, and it means that
bugs will be introduced to your software as you build the software, and there
will always be at least one more bug to solve, might not be seen, but it is
there.
