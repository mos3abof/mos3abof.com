Today I and my colleague Eslam were at Bank Masr because he was doing
something there. Not only the bank looks poor, in my opinion, but also
the screen on the wall got me stunned!

</p>

The screen was displaying a windows desktop with a folder minimized to
the task bar and a window of internet exploerer displaying a page
containing currency rates.

</p>

Apart from the ugliness of that page, the problem was they were showing
the internal IP address the browser is using!!!

</p>

`http://192.168.111.162/currencies/la2yenfa3.htm`

</p>

The page name itself **"la2yenfa3"** is the Egyptian Arabic slang to say
**"no it is possible"**! It was obvious two members at the IT were
arguing whether they can show this page or not!

</p>

I couldn't take a pic with my mobile at the time, but will the next time
i go there.

</p>

Oh did i mention that there was a warning too on the taskbar?!
