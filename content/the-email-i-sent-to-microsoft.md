Yesterday was a day of hell to me, because Internet Explorer deserves to
be renamed to "internet Exploder!"...

</p>

I was working on the project and everything was going just fine, it
looked very neat on firefox, opera and epiphany web browsers, with no
errors or annoying distortions of any kind, it even passed the test of
the w3c validator.

</p>

But when i was giving my client a status report, he told me the project
is messed up, i opened an [IE installation][] I have on my linux machine
and everything was really upside down, with no obvious reason why it
went like this!!

</p>

The client was upset, and he has the right to be so. So I spent all
today trying to fix what IE destroyed. I really hate their browser, it
is even not self-compatible, when you deal with IE the version differs
so much that you have to make hacks in your CSS and HTML code for each
and every version of them! How stupid that the same broswer renders html
in a totally different way just because you are using another version!!

</p>

Out of frustration i issued a ticket to Microsoft's customer support as
following:

</p>
<p>
> </p>
>
> **Subject :** Please stop releasing internet explorer
>
> </p>
>
> **Message :** Dear Sir/Madam, you don't know how much i am frustrated
> and filled with anger now because of your piece of software named
> Internet Explorer, I am in a very bad situation that is about to cost
> me a lot in my job because you don't care about web standards, and
> because of the unpredicted behaviour of your IE.
>
> </p>
>
> I please ask you seriously, and really you can't feel how much i feel
> badly inside, to stop releasing any further versions, stop shipping
> it, remove it from your websites and ask people not to use it anymore.
>
> </p>
>
> Thank you for your time, and your time only, but please stop using
> that time to make our lives like hell..
>
> </p>
> <p>

</p>

Today came a reply from an employee there :

</p>
<p>
> </p>
>
> Dear Mr. Mosab,
>
> </p>
>
> Thank you for contacting Microsoft Technical support. Kindly be
> informed that your complaint has been reported to the responsible
> team.

>
> Your feedback is highly appreciated.
