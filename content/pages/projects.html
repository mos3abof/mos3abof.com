        Egypt's Power Grid Load Status As A Web Service. A service parses the data in the Load Meter provided by
        The Egyptian Electric Utility and Consumer Protection Regulatory Agency (EGYPTERA) and presents it in a more
        human friendly way. It also provides an API so other developers can build other web and mobile applications
        on top of it.

        <dd>
        At work, long time ago, we had to track our working hours on Toggl (www.toggl.com), so I created this small
        project to calculate how many hours I should work to achieve my monthly goals.
