          Mosab is deft and friendly geek whom I've known for over a decade before finally working
          together in the same team.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p class="mb-0">
          Mosab possesses an impressive in-depth knowledge powered by relentless desire to dissect
          and understand the core of every technology he touches. This prowess allows him to easily
          digest new technologies and paradigms, ask the right questions, and to excel at managing
          systems on a large scale.  Combining that knowledge with agility gives him the gift of
          quickly changing lanes with no discourse.  Mosab has done that while maintaining a very
          positive attitude during the toughest times.
        </p>
        <br />
