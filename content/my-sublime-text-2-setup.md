I have been suffering for a while with IDEs, and ventured out to see
what options do I have. I ended up using mainly Vim and Sublime for a
long while now, and my life was never easier and I was never happier! In
this post however I am talking about my [Sublime Text][] Setup.

</p>

1. Package Control {#1-package-control}
------------------

</p>

You don't know what sublime is really capable of untill you install the
"[Package Control][]".

</p>

The website describes it as :

</p>
<p>
> </p>
>
> <em>A full-featured package manager that helps discovering,
> installing, updating and removing
>
> packages for Sublime Text 2. It features an automatic upgrader and
> supports GitHub,
>
> BitBucket and a full channel/repository system.</em>
>
> </p>
> <p>

</p>

If you are using Sublime and not using it, STOP READING & NOW GO
[INSTALL IT][]! After that go have a look [how to use it][].

</p>

2. The packages I use {#2-the-packages-i-use}
---------------------

</p>

I have a list of awesome packages I use :

</p>

-   **SublimeLinter** : Uses "lint" programs to highlight lines of code
    the linter deems to contain (potential) errors. It also supports
    highlighting special annotations (for example: TODO) so that they
    can be quickly located.
-   **SideBarEnhancements** : Adds lots of enhancements to default
    Sublime Text sidebar. Files and folders.
-   **GitHubinator** : Allows you to select text in a Sublime Text 2
    file, and see the highlighted lines on GitHub's remote repo, if one
    exists.
-   **Git** : Plugin for some git integration into Sublime Text.
-   **Djaneiro** : Django support for Sublime Text.
-   **SublimeCodeIntel** : Full-featured code intelligence and smart
    autocomplete engine.
-   **PHP-Twig** : Adds support for `.twig` template files.
-   **BracketHilighter** : Matches and higlights a variety of brackets
    for better readability.
-   **SublimeRope** : Adds Python completions and some IDE-like
    functions to Sublime Text.
-   **jQuery** : Provides help with jQuery functions.
-   **Xdebug** : Xdebug Interface for Sublime Text.
-   **SublimeREPL** : Helps you run an interpreter inside Sublime Text
    for various languages (like Python, Ruby, Shell) and you can
    configure it to run others as well.

</p>

To install any of these packages -after installing the Package Control-
press `ctrl+shift+p` then type `install package`. A list will appear
with all available packages to your, just click on the package you want
and voila!

</p>

I highly recommend you watch this video on Youtube : [Perfect Workflow
in Sublime Text 2][]. It might seem very long, but it is actually
divided into 10 minutes chunks -more or less- and it is one of the best
resources I have seen about Sublime.

</p>

Happy hacking/coding with Sublime :)
