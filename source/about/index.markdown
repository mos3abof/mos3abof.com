I am a proud Muslim Egyptian, a caffeine junkie, a food lover, supposedly a geek, a software engineer, an open source & free software believer and -finally- an entrepreneur in the make. Currently living in Cairo, Egypt.

###My Projects

1. [Shaghal.com](http://www.shaghal.com) : Currently Co-Founding an Arabic portal that is specialiezed in entrepreneurship, employment and labor market, where I handle all the Technology related stuff.

2. [Zobad.net](http://www.zobad.net) : The best of the internet for Arab users! A platform that collects and aggregates interesting content for Arab internet users. Currently it serves only videos, but soon will serve other stuff as well.

3. [My open source projects](http://www.github.com/mos3abof) : I have some open source projects that I keep at [Github account](http://www.github.com/mos3abof).

4. Mastery Gauge : Author of many best sellers Malcolm Galdwell said in his book "Outliers" that experts reached the conclusion that in order to master a skill, a tool or a job you need to spend at least 10 thousand hours deliberately practicing it! This project is a simple zen tracker for people to track their journey to greatness and mastery of what they want.

5. Vishen's Excercise : An online application that makes it easier to practice an excercise devised by Vishen Lakhiani, co-founder and CEO of Mindvalley, that is designed to change the way you plan your life and see your goals. It'll change the way you see your career, mission, and life purpose unfolding.


###Projects I Worked On

1. [Wuzzuf](http://www.wuzzuf.com) (formerly basharjobs): A really smart, revolutionary and a next generation recruitment platform, I had the honor of leading the development team under supervision from the startup's CTO and I pretty much laid the software architecture under this great project.

2. [20at.com](http://www.20at.com): A youth oriented editorial site that was really pouplar and first of a kind in the Arab world. I developed the whole project from scratch to meet the needs of the editorial team. This was the start of my career.

3. Virtual Volunteering E-Course: I designed and taught an online course on the topic of "virtual volunteering", conducted on Islamonline.net e-training service, the course duration was a month and contained a graduation project. Because of this course the company won the "Volunteering Award of the year for foundations" in Qatar in Summer 2006.

I have also worked on many intranet and applications that either were subcontracted or meant for internal use by the client(s) on freelancing and/or contract basis.

###Mosab's Law Of Conservation of Software Bugs

{% blockquote Mosab Ahmad, http://www.mos3abof.com %}
Software Bugs may be created but can not be fully destroyed.
{% endblockquote %}

This law is inspired by the law of conservation of energy, and it means that bugs will be introduced to your software as you build the software, a nd there will always be at least one more bug to solve, might not be seen, but it is there.
